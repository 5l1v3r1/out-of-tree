# out-of-tree called make with four arguments:
# - KERNEL: kernel headers path
# - TARGET_EXPLOIT: name of exploit binary that MUST be produced by makefile.
# - $(TARGET_EXPLOIT)_test: name of test binary that MUST be produced by makefile
# and it's will be runned on a LPE stage. TARGET_TEST MUST accept two argument:
#   - Path to exploit binary
#   - File that MUST be created with exploit. It uses for test that exploit works
#     correctly.
# - VMLINUZ: path to vmlinuz
#
# e.g.:
#    make KERNEL=/lib/modules/4.8.0-58-generic/build \
#         TARGET_EXPLOIT=nyan-exploit \
#         TARGET_TEST=nyan-exploit-test
#         VMLINUZ=/boot/vmlinuz-4.8.0-58-generic
