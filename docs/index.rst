out-of-tree
===========

*out-of-tree* is the kernel {module, exploit} development tool.

*out-of-tree* was created on the purpose of decreasing complexity of
environment for developing, testing and debugging Linux kernel
exploits and out-of-tree kernel modules (that's why tool got a name
"out-of-tree").

While I'm trying to keep that documentation up-to-date, there may be
some missing information. Use ``out-of-tree --help-long`` for checking
all features.

If you found anything missed here, please make a pull request or send
patches to patch@dumpstack.io.

If you need personal support, your company is interested in the
project or you just want to share some thoughts -- feel free to write
to root@dumpstack.io.
